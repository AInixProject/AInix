      doc: >
          A type parser which chooses its type and the string by choosing the
          implementation with the type_data property ParseRepresentation that
          matches the longest length at the beginning of the input string.

      name: regex_group_object_parser
      doc: >
          A object parser based off regex. Each arg should have the arg_data
          property "RegexRepresentation" defined. The arg is considered present
          if its RegexRepresentation matches. The first 1st group is passed
          on to the next parser.
          So for example, if an arg had the RegexRepresentation of
          "ab([0-9]+)cd", then the string "ab123cd" would be considered present
          and the substring "123" would be selected to pass on. For the string
          "abcde" the arg would not be considered present.
